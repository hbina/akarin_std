# akarin_std
Some C++ templated data structures made for learning purposes.
I will try not to use anything from the standard library with some exceptions.

# What Have Been Implemented So Far

1. vector
2. monad

# Exceptions

I will list stuff that I did use here:

1. `std::size_t`
2. `std::iostream`
